%use breadthdist.m from brain connectivity toolbox

%produce an undirected weighted random network
nodes=30;
w=rand(nodes,nodes);

for k=1:nodes
    for l=(k+1):nodes

%Calling threshold schemes

[binary w]= threshold_abs(w, thr);

%Threshold that keeps a per centage of the strongest connections
p=0.3;
[binary w] = threshold_pro(w, p);

%Threshold based on mean degree

%Threshold based on the maximization of the global cost efficiency
th=100;
[binary threshold globalcosteffmax costmax ef]=threshold_global_cost_efficiency(w,th);

%Threshold based on the shortest path lengths
%The input matrix must be a mapping from weight to distance. For 
%   instance, in a weighted correlation network, higher correlations are 
%   more naturally interpreted as shorter distances, and the input matrix 
%   should consequently be some inverse of the connectivity matrix.

%EXTRA FUNCTIONS
%Here we selected a k in order to detect the surviving nodes that are
%connected with at least k connections
%You can use binary matrix as extracted from each of the above techniques
k2=10;

%The resulting minimally rewired networks lbmrn represented
% a lower bound for the wiring length of a connected network
% with the same total number of edges and identical node positions as
% in the original neural networks.
