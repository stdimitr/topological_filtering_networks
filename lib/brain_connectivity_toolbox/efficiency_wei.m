function E=efficiency_wei(Gw,local)
%EFFICIENCY_WEI     Global efficiency, local efficiency.
%
%   Eglob = efficiency_wei(Gw);
%   Eloc = efficiency_wei(Gw,1);
%
%   The global efficiency is the average of inverse shortest path length, 
%   and is inversely related to the characteristic path length.
%
%   The local efficiency is the global efficiency computed on the
%   neighborhood of the node, and is related to the clustering coefficient.
%
%   Inputs:     Gw,             undirected weighted connection matrix
%                                 all weights in Gw must be between 0 and 1.
%               local,          optional argument
%                                 local=1 computes local efficiency.
%
%   Output:     Eglob,          global efficiency (scalar)
%               Eloc,           local efficiency (vector)
%
%   Notes:
%       The  efficiency is computed using an auxiliary connection-length
%   matrix L, defined as L_ij = 1./Gw_ij for all nonzero L_ij; This has an
%   intuitive interpretation, as higher connection weights intuitively
%   correspond to shorter lengths.
%       The weighted local efficiency broadly parallels the weighted
%   clustering coefficient often Onnela et al. (2005) and distinguishes the
%   influence of different paths based on connection weights of the
%   corresponding neighbors to the node in question. In other words, a path
%   between two neighbors with strong connections to the node in question
%   contributes more to the local efficiency than a path between two weakly
%   connected neighbors. Note that this weighted variant of the local
%   efficiency is hence not a strict generalization of the binary variant.
%
%   Algorithm:  Dijkstra's algorithm
